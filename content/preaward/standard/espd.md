Article 59 of the new Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EC introduced a new concept, the European Single Procurement Document (ESPD) which is a self-declaration document intended for preliminary evidence in a public procurement procedure. The main objective of the ESPD is to reduce the administrative burden and lead to considerable simplification of participation in public procurement procedures for buyers and suppliers. ESPD will reduce the burden by removing the need to produce a substantial number of certificates and documentation related to exclusion and selection criteria.

Documentation and services related to ESPD are provided by the European Commission.

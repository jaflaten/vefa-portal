The validation service is available in two different flavours, one containing the current version of the validation rules and one containing the next version of the validation rules. Upcoming versions of validation rules are available for review according to the [release management](/ehf/knowledge-base/release-management/).

This service is provided free of change and is served at a best effort basis. Using the service for production data is not allowed, and will result in blocking of IPs.

Based on feedback Difi has found it necessary to renew their commitment to the validator. **The new validator is not backward compatible** as it is designed to meet the current and future needs.

As part of introducing a new validator will current validator no longer be supported.

This is the schedule Difi will follow:

* June 1st, 2015: [An early version](http://vefa.difi.no/validator2/) was made available for testing.
* August 1st, 2015: Code for the validator will be available as [open source on Github](https://github.com/difi/vefa-validator).
* August 1st, 2015: New validator introduced as standard on test.vefa.difi.no. **The old validator and Web Service interface will be removed.**
* October 1st, 2015: New validator introduced as standard on vefa.difi.no. **The old validator and Web Service interface will be removed.**
* February 1st, 2016: From this date the Github repository for configuration of the validator will be cultivated to be a EHF repository.

This is a notification of the forthcoming EHF Invoice and Credit Note 3.0. The new major version implements [EU Directive 2014/55/EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0055&from=EN) in Norway.

The new standard will build upon the forthcoming PEPPOL BIS Invoicing 3.0 and/or PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 (awaiting decision in OpenPEPPOL) outlined by [PEPPOL Invoice Pre-Study (PIPS)](http://www.peppol.eu/news/CallforparticipationinPEPPOLInvoice%20pre-study). The new PEPPOL BIS is expected to be a Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) of EN 16931 (result of [CEN TC434](https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:7:0::::FSP_ORG_ID:1883209&cs=1E81C9C833655EEDC7010C8D0A2FB786C)).

Difi urge invoicing communities in Norway to involve themselves in PEPPOL BIS and EHF workgroups. We will publish further information about workgroups as soon as this information is available and use existing forums to engage current users of EHF.

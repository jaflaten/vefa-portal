OpenPEPPOL membership is mandatory for Access Point providers. You will find the details in the section [How to join](https://peppol.eu/get-involved/join-openpeppol/). The OpenPEPPOL Membership form has to be filled in, signed, scanned and sent back to [oo@peppol.eu](mailto:openpeppol@peppol.eu).

OpenPEPPOL will review the form for completeness. You will then receive a notification from OpenPEPPOL to confirm receipt and will be informed about membership approval. Once approved, your organisation will be included in the online list of [OpenPEPPOL members](https://peppol.eu/who-is-who/openpeppol-member-list-2/).

We strongly recommend engaging with the OpenPEPPOL Coordinating Communities as soon as you become an OpenPEPPOL member, in order to have access to a wide group of private and public sector members with PEPPOL expertise in multiple countries and industries, sharing experience and best practices.
 
For information about fees, please see bottom of [Join OpenPEPPOL](https://peppol.eu/get-involved/join-openpeppol/).

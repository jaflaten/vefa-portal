After maintenance of ELMA tonight, the communication between ELMA and SML has been failing for users using the WS interface for administration.

The problem is related to differences between Java 7 and Java 8. We will downgrade to Java 7, and expect this to be done by 14:00 CEST today.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

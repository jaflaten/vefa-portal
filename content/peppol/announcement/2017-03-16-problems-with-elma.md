We are experiencing problems with ELMA related to administration of SML.

Functionality affected:

* Adding and removing participants.

Functionality not affected:

* Updating supported profiles.

Update 12:44 CET: We've traced this to be related to authentication in the SML application. CEF is working to fix this issue.

This announcement will be updated as soon as we have new information.
